Now that we've all moved to Cloud, or at least are in the process of doing so, a lot of organizations are trying to modernize
their internal D&R programs to leverage all the shiny capabilities that come with an infrastructure control plane and fully
managed services. For many organizations, however, that initial onboarding boils down to shoehorning traditional programs and
capabilities into their cloud environments which, while viable in the short term, misses on a lot of powerful capabilities.

Cloud Detection & Response being my bread and butter these days, I thought it might be discuss a few of the areas of modernization
one should consider when building out their Cloud D&R program. This is by no means an exhaustive list, and I might write future
posts on the topic should this one prove helpful.

In this post, we will cover:

- Understanding the role of IAM and audit logs
- Preparing an asset inventory
- Identifying and gaining access to internal enrichment sources
- Understand workload ephemerality and how that impacts response
