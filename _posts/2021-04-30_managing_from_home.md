I've been managing remotely for the past five years, after a few more years of being an individual contributor both in office and remotely.

Engineering management is hard. You need to be a good engineer, but also a good manager. People typically get into the field by being good engineers for long enough that it is assumed they'll also be good managers. But people are not computers, and you can't engineer your way around managing a team efficiently.

Managing in person is no easy task. Add to that the communication caveats of being remote, top it off with a pandemic, and you get a perfect recipe for bad management and the risk of pushing out good team members.

So this is a small collection of management advice I've picked up over the years. They are useful when you're managing remotely, but you could/should probably apply them to all management settings.

1. Measure transparently
1. Get peer feedback regularly
1. Break the isolation
1. Mentor explicitely and implicitely
1. Build trust first, then camaraderie
1. Moderate disagreement
1. Turn your face into words

# Measure transparently
