I've been managing remotely for the past five years, after a decade of being an individual contributor both in office and remotely.

Engineering management is hard. You need to be a good engineer, but also a good manager. New managers typically get into the field by being good engineers for long enough that it is assumed they'll also be good managers. But people are not computers, and you can't engineer your way around managing a team efficiently. It's an entirely new set of skills you have to learn, and one where making mistakes has direct consequences on people's careers and livelihood. 

Managing is no easy task. Add to that the communication caveats of being remote, top it off with a pandemic, and you get a perfect recipe for bad management and the risk of pushing out good team members. I've seen it, you've seen it, we've all witnessed at some point in our professional lives what bad managers do to people, first, but also teams, projects and, ultimately, companies.

So this is a small collection of management advice I've picked up over the years. They are useful when you're managing remotely, but you could -and probably should - apply them to all management settings. It's not an exhaustive list, and if this were a youtube video I'd tell you to leave your remote management tips in the comments below, but instead why don't you ping me on twitter @jvehent.

1. Measure transparently

The routine of a remote manager is very different from that of an office manager. While your calendar is still split in 30min/1h meetings all day long, you'll see your entire team as a group perhaps once a twice a week, as opposed to every day for 8h a day. Your team members get a **lot less** of your time when you're remote than in the office, and as a result, they also lose the micro-feedback on they performance they'd normally get by talking to you several times a day.

So you need to be explicit on how you measure their performance. It's not enough to set one lofty goal for the entire team and the entire quarter. Each member of the team needs to have their own goals, with clear success criteria, and you need to give them clear feedback on how they are performing against those goals.

If you're familiar with the [OKR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) model, then you're already half way there. OKRs help create an environment where success criteria are clearly defined, and where an individual contributor has clear visibility into what they need to achieve to meet their performance goals.

But you also need to support that process by discussing performance regularly in 1:1s. The difference when operating remotely is that you can't expect this feedback to transpire through everyday conversation and confidence reinforcement. It needs to be explicitely mentioned in 1:1s because that's the only time of the week your team members have access to you.

Don't surprise your folks with a bad performance review at the end of the quarter. Have these conversation every week. And if they are doing well, assume they don't know that and also have that conversation regularly.

The ultimate goal here is to be so transparent about how you're measuring performance that folks can self-assess against the ladder you've set for them, and when you have those performance conversation, there's no surprise at all.

1. Get peer feedback regularly

Another caveat of not being in the office is that impromptu conversations happen less often. They don't completely disappear, because you still have 1:1s with folks regularly, but they don't happen naturally anymore.

So the feedback you'd normally be getting from a team member about another team member being stuck on a project and struggling is much harder to obtain, and you'll have to fish it out of people to get it. I could ask, and I do ask, everyone how they're doing at a personal and professional level on a regular basis, but people being what they are, I don't always get a straight answer. And obviously the power dynamics of manager to employee will tamper with these conversations. So peer feedback is an important data point in evaluating where my team is at.

Personally, I like to ask folks how their peers are doing on a regular basis. I'm not asking for anyone to snitch on anyone else (and, going back to point 1, I measure transparently anyway). The feedback I seek is entirely focused on preserving the health of the team, both for benefit of the team members themselves and for the quality of the work we produce.

Humans will naturally look out for each other in a group setting. And when we're all in the office, this happens naturally, without anyone noticing. But, here again, these mechanisms don't automatically activate in remote settings, so we, as managers, have to foster them and make them explicit. Get feedback on your people, it'll help you get better visibility into the health of your team.

1. Break the isolation
1. Mentor explicitely and implicitely
1. Build trust first, then camaraderie
1. Moderate disagreement
1. Turn your face into words
