This is a small collection of management advice I've picked up over the years. I find them useful when managing remote teams, but you could - and probably should - apply them to all management settings. It's not by any mean an exhaustive list. At best it's a starting point in making one think through the way they manage engineering teams.

# Background

I've been managing remotely for the past five years, after a decade of being an individual contributor both in office and remotely. Engineering management is hard. You need to be a good engineer, but also a good manager. New managers typically get into the field by being good engineers for long enough that it is assumed they'll also be good managers. But people are not computers, and you can't engineer your way around managing a team efficiently. It's an entirely new set of skills you have to learn, and one where making mistakes has direct consequences on people's careers and livelihood. 

When managing remote teams, communication is harder, building a culture takes more time, detecting and handling performance issues is more difficult, etc. All the signals you'd naturally collect by being surrounded by the people you manage for several hours a day must not be specificallyacquired through well established processes. I'd like to describe some of those processes that I found useful.

# 1. Measure transparently

The routine of a remote manager is very different from that of an office manager. While your calendar is still split in 30min/1h meetings all day long, you'll see your entire team as a group perhaps once a twice a week, as opposed to eight hours every day. Your team members get a **lot less** of your time, and as a result, they also lose the micro-feedback on they performance they'd normally get by talking to you several times a day.

So you need to be explicit on how you measure their performance. It's not good enough to set one lofty goal for the entire team and the entire quarter. Each member of the team needs to have their own goals, with clear success criteria, and you need to continuously give them clear and actionable feedback on how they are performing against those goals.

If you're familiar with the [OKR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) model, then you're already half way there. OKRs help create an environment where success criteria are clearly defined, and where an individual contributor has clear visibility into what they need to achieve to meet their performance goals. But you also need to support that process by discussing performance regularly in 1:1s. When managing remote teams, you can't expect this feedback to transpire through everyday conversations and confidence reinforcement. It needs to be explicit, ideally during 1:1s because that's the only time of the week your team members have access to you.

Don't surprise folks with a bad performance reviews at the end of the quarter. Have these conversations every week. Whether they are doing poorly or really well, you should assume that they are not fully aware of it, and provide that feedback regularly.

The ultimate goal here is to be so transparent about how you're measuring performance that folks can self-assess against the ladder you've set for them, and when you have those performance conversations, there's no surprise at all.

# 2. Get peer feedback regularly

Somewhat related to the previous point, managing remote teams makes it harder to get a full checkup on the health of the team and its contributors. In an office, you'd get data points through every day conversation, but those become harder to acquire when remote. So the feedback you'd normally be getting from a team member about another team member being stuck on a project and struggling is harder to obtain. You'll have to specifically collect it from folks to get it.

You should ask each of your team members how they're doing at a professional (and sometimes personal, when appropriate) level on a regular basis, but people being people, I don't always get a straight answer. The power dynamics of managers to employees also tampers with these conversations. So you can't rely on that feedback alone, and need to collect peer feedback on a regular basis, explicitely.

When asking for team members how their peers are doing, the feedback I seek is entirely focused on preserving the health of the team, both for benefit of the team members themselves and for the quality of the work we produce. The goal isn't to have team members tell on each other, but truly to identify issues I may not have directly notice, so I can resolve them before they become problematic.

Humans will naturally look out for each other in a group setting. And when we're all in the office, this happens naturally, without anyone noticing. But, here again, these mechanisms don't automatically activate in remote settings. As managers, we have to foster them and make them explicit. Get feedback on your people, it'll help you get better visibility into the health of your team.

# 3. Break the isolation

It's been a tough year. And for many, it's been their first year of remote work. The saying goes that pandemic-work-from-home is not work-from-home, which is true, and we are dealing with an extreme level of isolation. But it is also true that being fully remote, even outside a pandemic, can make you feel very detached from your team.

Managers can help break the isolation by creating 

1. Mentor explicitely and implicitely
1. Build trust first, then camaraderie
1. Moderate disagreement
1. Turn your face into words
